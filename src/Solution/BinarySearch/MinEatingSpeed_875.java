/**
 * Koko loves to eat bananas.
 * There are N piles of bananas, the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in H hours.
 * Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of K.
 * Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.
 * If the pile has less than K bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.
 * Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.
 * Return the minimum integer K such that she can eat all the bananas within H hours.
 * Note:
 * 1 <= piles.length <= 10^4
 * piles.length <= H <= 10^9
 * 1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9
