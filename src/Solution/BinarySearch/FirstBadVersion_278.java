/**
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
 * Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
 * Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one.
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad.
 * Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
