 * Given an array of integers target. From a starting array, A consisting of all 1's, perform the following procedures:
 * 1. let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
 * 2. choose index i, such that 0 <= i < target.size and set the value of A at index i to x.
 * 3. You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.
 * Return True if it is possible to construct the target array from A otherwise return False.
