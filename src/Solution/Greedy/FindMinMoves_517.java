 * You have n super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty.

 * Given an integer array representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line.
 * Find the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses.
 * If it is not possible to do it, return -1.

     * If there is one machine requires clothes, then it can only obtained from its adjacent machine.
     * Hence, the steps can be calculated by (previous dress needed + current dress having).
