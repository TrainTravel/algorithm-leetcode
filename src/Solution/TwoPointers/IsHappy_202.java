 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
 * Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
 * Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle.
 * Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
