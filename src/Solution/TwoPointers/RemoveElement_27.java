/**
 * Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array
 * It must be done by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
 * Note:
 * 1. Input array is passed in by reference, modification to it will be known to the caller as well.
