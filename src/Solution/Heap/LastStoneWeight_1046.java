 * There is a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

 * The result of this smash is:
 * 1. If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
 * 2. If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
 * At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.
 * Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
