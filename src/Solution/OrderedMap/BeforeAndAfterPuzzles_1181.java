/**
 * Given a list of phrases, generate a list of Before and After puzzles.
 * A phrase is a string that consists of lowercase English letters and spaces only.
 * No space appears in the start or the end of a phrase. There are no consecutive spaces in a phrase.
 * Phrases can be formed by merging two phrases where the last word of the one phrase is same as the first word of the other phrase.
 * Return the Before and After puzzles that can be formed by every two phrases phrases[i] and phrases[j] where i != j.
 * Note that the order of matching two phrases matters, we want to consider both orders.
 * You should return a list of distinct strings sorted lexicographically.
