/**
 * Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes).
 * Write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.
 * Note:
 * 1. No duplicate edges will appear in edges.
 * 2. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
