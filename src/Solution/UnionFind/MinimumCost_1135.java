/**
 * There are N cities numbered from 1 to N.
 * You are given connections, each with [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect city1 and city2 together.
 * A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1 and city2 is the same as connecting city2 and city1.
 * Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections that connects those two cities together.
 * The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.
