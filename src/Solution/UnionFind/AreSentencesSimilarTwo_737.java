/**
 * Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs.
 * Determine if two sentences are similar.
 * For example:
 * words1 = ["great", "acting", "skills"]
 * words2 = ["fine", "drama", "talent"]
 * pairs = [["great", "good"], ["fine", "good"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].
 * Then words1 and words2 are similar.
 * Note that the similarity relation is transitive.
 * For example, if "great" and "good" are similar, "fine" and "good" are similar, then "great" and "fine" are similar.
 * Similarity is symmetric.
 * For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.
 * Also, a word is always similar with itself.
 * For example:
 * words1 = ["great"]
 * words2 = ["great"]
 * pairs = []
 * They are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.
 * Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words.
 * So a sentence like words1 = ["great"] can never be similar to words2 = ["doubleplus","good"].
 * Note:
 * 1. The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
 * 2. The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
 * 3. The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
 * 4. The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].
