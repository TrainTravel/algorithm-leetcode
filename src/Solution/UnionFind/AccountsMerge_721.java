/**
 * Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings.
 * First element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
 * Merge these accounts.
 * Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts.
 * Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name.
 * A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
 * After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format:
 * First element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order.
 * The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
 * Note:
 * 1. The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000].
 * 2. The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
 * 3. The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].
