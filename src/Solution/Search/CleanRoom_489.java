/**
 * Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.
 * The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position. This robot works as "blindfolded".
 * Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.
 * The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 90 degrees.
 * Robot can only use the mentioned 4 APIs, without knowing the room layout and the initial robot's position.
 * When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it stays on the current cell.
 * Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs shown below.
 * Notes:
 * 1. The robot's initial position will always be in an accessible cell.
 * 2. The initial direction of the robot will be facing up.
 * 3. All accessible cells are connected. All cells marked as 1 will be accessible by the robot.
 * 4. Assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by wall.
