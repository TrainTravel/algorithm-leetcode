     * Binary search.
     * To find median, two arrays should be divided into 4 parts, 2 smaller and 2 large.
     * The elements in different part can only at most has a difference of 1.
     * That is to say, abs[(small1 + small2) - (larger1 + larger2)]<=1.
     * If total length of two arrays are even, then it can be evenly divided into two parts.
     * Otherwise, one part will have one more element.
     * The way to find the correct partition is using binary search in first array.
     * Note that to avoid out of bound exception, the first array should be assured as shorter array.
     * Each time, the first array will be divided into two parts.
     * Since this array is sorted, the two parts will be assured to be one small part, and one large part.
     * Then, the partition position of second array will be fixed as well:
     * middle2 = (nums2.length + nums1.length + 1) / 2 - middle1
     * Index smaller than middle2 will be divided into small2 and larger elements will be divided into large2.
     * To ensure the division is correct, check if this maxLeft1 <= minRight2 && maxLeft2 <= minRight1 is met.
     * If both conditions are matched, then median can be found.
     *
     * @param nums1 first sorted array with length m
     * @param nums2 second sorted array with length n
     * @return median of the two sorted arrays
