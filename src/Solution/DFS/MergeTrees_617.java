 * Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other.

 * You need to merge them into a new binary tree.
 * The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
 * Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
