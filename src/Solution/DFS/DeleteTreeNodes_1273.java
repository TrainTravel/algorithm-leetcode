 * A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:
 * 1. The number of nodes is nodes;
 * 2. The value of the i-th node is value[i];
 * 3. The parent of the i-th node is parent[i].
 * 4. Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.
 * After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.
 * Constraints:
 * 1. 1 <= nodes <= 10^4
 * 2. -10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5
 * 3. parent.length == nodes
 * 4. parent[0] == -1 which indicates that 0 is the root.
