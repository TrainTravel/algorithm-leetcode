 * Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.

 * For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.
 * For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.
 * Return the sum of these numbers.
