/**
 * Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.
 * We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.
 * n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.
 * Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.
 * The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.
 * Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.
 * In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node.
 * (left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
 * If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.
 * If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.
 * You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.
 * If it is not possible, return false.
