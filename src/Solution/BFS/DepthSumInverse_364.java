 * Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.
 * Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
 * Weight is defined from bottom up.
 * i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the largest weight.

     * BFS, similar to level order traversal.
     * The structure of nested integer is similar to a rootless tree, where the actual root is an "invisible" node.
     * Nested integer can be represented as node of tree, and getList() is calling the child of current node.
     * Meanwhile, the weight of each level is same. Therefore, use BFS to collect nodes in each level.
     * The target is to calculate the sum of each node with different depth, depth is reversed compare to tree depth.
     * To calculate sum of nodes, simply add previous sum one more time after calculate each level's sum.
     * The deeper the tree is, the more time upper nodes sum will be added, and will be exactly same as their depth.
