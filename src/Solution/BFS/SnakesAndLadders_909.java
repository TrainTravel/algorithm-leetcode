/**
 * On an N x N board, the numbers from 1 to N*N are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board.
 * Directions are alternating each row.
 * For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:
 * You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).
 * Each move, starting from square x, consists of the following:
 * You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.
 * If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.
 * A board square on row r and column c has a "snake or ladder" if board[r][c] != -1.
 * The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].
 * Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move:
 * If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.
 * Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.
 * If it is not possible, return -1.
