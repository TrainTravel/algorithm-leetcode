/**
 * A perfect binary tree is given where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node.
 * If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * Note:
 * 1. You may only use constant extra space.
 * 2. Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
