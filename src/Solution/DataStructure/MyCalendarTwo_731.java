/**
 * Implement a MyCalendarTwo class to store your events.
 * A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.
 * Your class will have one method, book(int start, int end).
 * Formally, this represents a half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
 * A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection.
 * For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully.
 * Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
