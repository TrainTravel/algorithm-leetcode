/**
 * Design your implementation of the circular queue.
 * The circular queue is a linear data structure performing FIFO principle.
 * The last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.
 * It is also called "Ring Buffer".
 * One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue.
 * In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, next element can not be inserted into queue.
 * But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.
 * Your implementation should support following operations:
 * 1. MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
 * 2. Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
 * 3. Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
 * 4. enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
 * 5. deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
 * 6. isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
 * 7. isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
