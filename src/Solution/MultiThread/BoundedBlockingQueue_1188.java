/**
 * Implement a thread safe bounded blocking queue that has the following methods:
 * 1. BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity): The constructor initializes the queue with a maximum capacity.
 * 2. void enqueue(int element): Adds an element to the front of the queue.
 * If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer full.
 * 3. int dequeue(): Returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it.
 * If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty.
 * 4. int size(): Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.
 * Your implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time.
 * Each thread will either be a producer only makes calls to the enqueue or a consumer only makes calls to the dequeue.
 * The size method will be called after every test case.
 * Please do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be accepted in an interview.
