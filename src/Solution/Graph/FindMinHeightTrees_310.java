/**
 * For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root.
 * The result graph is then a rooted tree.
 * Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 * Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.
 * Format:
 * The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).
 * No duplicate edges will appear in edges.
 * Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
 * Note:
 * 1. A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.
 * 2. The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
