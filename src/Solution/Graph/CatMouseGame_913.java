/**
 * A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.
 * The graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of the graph.
 * Mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, Cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a Hole at node 0.
 * During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are.
 * For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1].
 * Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)
 * Then, the game can end in 3 ways:
 * 1. If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
 * 2. If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
 * 3. If ever a position is repeated (ie. the players are in the same position), the game is a draw.
 * Given a graph, and assuming both players play optimally, return 1 if Mouse win, 2 if Cat win, and 0 if is a draw.
