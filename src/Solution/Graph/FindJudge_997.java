 * In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.
 * There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 * If the town judge exists, then:
 * 1. The town judge trusts nobody.
 * 2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 * 3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 * You are given trust, trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.
 * If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge. Otherwise, return -1.
