/**
 * There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.
 * For each house i, it can either build a well inside with cost wells[i], or pipe in water from another well to it.
 * The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes.
 * Each pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost] represents the cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe.
 * Connections are bidirectional.
 * Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.
