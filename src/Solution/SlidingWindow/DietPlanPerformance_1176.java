 * A dieter consumes calories[i] calories on the i-th day.
 * For every consecutive sequence of k days, they look at T, the total calories consumed during that sequence of k days:
 * If T < lower, they performed poorly on their diet and lose 1 point;
 * If T > upper, they performed well on their diet and gain 1 point;
 * Otherwise, they performed normally and there is no change in points.
 * Return the total number of points the dieter has after all calories.length days.
 * Note that: The total points could be negative.
