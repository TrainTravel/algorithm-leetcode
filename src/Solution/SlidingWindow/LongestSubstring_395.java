     * There are 26 letters in total, so the window contains the number of unique char i from 1 to 26
     * If the window contains less than i, then enlarge window.
     * If the window contains more than i, shrink the window.
     * If the window contains i unique chars and each repeats at least k times, one substring is found.
     * Finally, find the max window.
