/**
 * A company wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems.
 * But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks.
 * Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take.
 * There are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.
 * Rules and restrictions:
 * 1. You can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.
 * 2. The cities are connected by flights that represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), from the city i to j.
 * 3. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.
 * 4. You totally have K weeks to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day.
 * 5. For each city, you only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship.
 * 6. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.
 * Given the flights matrix and days matrix, output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.
 * Note:
 * 1. N and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].
 * 2. In the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].
 * 3. In the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].
 * 4. You could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.
 * 5. If you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.
 * 6. We don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days.
