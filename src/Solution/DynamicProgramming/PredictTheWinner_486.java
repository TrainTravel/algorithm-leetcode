/**
 * Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers.
 * Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on.
 * Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player.
 * This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.
 * Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner.
 * You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.

     * Min-max problem. Solved by dynamic programming.
     * The key of this problem is to correctly define dp[i][j].
     * State transition:
     * dp[i][j]: how much more scores the first-in-action player will get from i to j than the second player.
     * dp[i][j] = max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]), where 0 <= i < j < n and i + j < n.
     * Base case:
     * dp[i][i] = i
     * At each dp[i][j], the max dp[i][j] is actually to find the max result that last player can get.
     * The reason is that under the rule of game, each player will try the strategy that max its score.
     * Therefore, to find if player 1 can win, check the max points player 2 can reach and decide if player 1 can win.
