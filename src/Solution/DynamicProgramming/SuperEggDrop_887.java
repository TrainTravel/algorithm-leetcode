/**
 * Given K eggs, and the access to a building with N floors from 1 to N.
 * Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.
 * There exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break
 * And any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break.
 * Each move, take an egg (if there is an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N).
 * Goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.
 * What is the minimum number of moves that need to know with certainty what F is, regardless of the initial value of F?
