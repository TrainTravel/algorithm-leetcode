/**
 * In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.
 * The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.
 * Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
 * Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
 * 1. a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
 * 2. a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
 * 3. a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
 * The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.
 * For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
 * Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
 * Note:
 * 1. 1 <= days.length <= 365
 * 2. 1 <= days[i] <= 365
 * 3. days is in strictly increasing order.
 * 4. costs.length == 3
 * 5. 1 <= costs[i] <= 1000
