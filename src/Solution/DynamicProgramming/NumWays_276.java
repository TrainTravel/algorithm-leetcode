     * Basic dynamic programming.
     * At most two posts can be painted at same color.
     * Hence, the number of ways to paint ith post is based on number of ways to with same color and different color.
     * Ways to paint different color is obvious, dp[i - 1] * (k - 1).
     * To paint same color, it should be guarantee that no three consecutive post with same color.
     * Therefore, it is actually the number of ways of painting (i - 1)th post with different color from (i - 2)th post.
     * State transition:
     * dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * (k - 1) + dp[i - 2] * (k - 1)
     * dp[i - 1] * (k - 1): paint ith post with different color from the (i - 1)th post
     * dp[i - 2] * (k - 1): paint (i - 1)th post with different color from the (i - 2)th post
     * Base cases:
     * dp[0] = 0;
     * dp[1] = k;
     * dp[2] = k * k;
     *
     * @param n n posts
     * @param k k colors
     * @return the total number of ways you can paint the fence
