 * Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.
 * There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].
 * The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.
 * Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.
 * On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.
 * Then, set M = max(M, X).
 * The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
 * Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.
