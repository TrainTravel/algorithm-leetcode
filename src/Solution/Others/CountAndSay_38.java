/**
 * The first line of the initial value is 1.
 * The second line reads the first line, one is 1, which is 11.
 * The third line reads the second line, 2, so the third line is 21.
 * The fourth line reads the third line, one 2, one 1, so the fourth line is 1211.
 * The fifth line reads the fourth line, one 1, one 2, two 1, so the fifth flight is 111221.
 * The sixth line reads the fifth line, three 1, two 2, one 1, so the sixth line is 312211.
 * Then the question asks for any number of lines from 1 - 30 to output the line.
