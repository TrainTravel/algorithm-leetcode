 * Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it.
 * If no such solution, return -1.
 * For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".
 * Return 3, by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it.
 * Note: The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
