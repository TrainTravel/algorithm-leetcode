     * The solution is using stack or deque.
     * First, iterate the array to count each char's appearance. Then iterate this array again.
     * If found a char in stack, pass this char, and in this way to remove all duplicated character.
     * Otherwise, pop out all characters that is larger than current character AND contains duplicate.
     * Use a boolean array to record duplicated character. When pop out character, mark popped character as unvisited.
     * Add current character to stack and continue this process until the whole string is traversed.
