/**
 * On a single threaded CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between 0 and N-1.
 * We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.
 * Each log is a string with this format: "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}".
 * For example, "0:start:3" means the function with id 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3.
 * "1:end:2" means the function with id 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2.
 * A function's exclusive time is the number of units of time spent in this function.
 * Note that this does not include any recursive calls to child functions.
 * The CPU is single threaded which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.
 * Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.
