 * Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:
 * 1. Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
 * 2. The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.
 * (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
 * 3. The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.
 * Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.
 * It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.
