/**
 * You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You give a number and ask your friend to guess it.
 * When guessing, return how many digits are exactly same, and how many digits are right but in wrong position.
 * Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.
 * Write a function to return a hint by the secret number and guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B for cows.
 * Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.
