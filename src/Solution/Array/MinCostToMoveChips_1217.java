 * There are some chips, and the i-th chip is at position chips[i].

 * Move the i-th chip by 2 units to the left or to the right with a cost of 0.
 * Move the i-th chip by 1 unit to the left or to the right with a cost of 1.
 * There can be two or more chips at the same position initially.
 * Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position (any position).
