 * On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:

 * - 2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
 * - 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
 * - -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
 * Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.
